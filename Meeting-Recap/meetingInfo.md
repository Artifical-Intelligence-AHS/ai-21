**September 13th 2021**

We presented the following PowerPoint to the class: https://tinyurl.com/IntroductionPowerPointAIClub
We showed an AI demo in which Kunal use Yolo to show an Image Detection system
We showed Codex and learned why: Rishab being late to the AI club meeting is "Unknown" (Codex has a chat bot in which you can ask any question, we had fun with it like asking questions including - What is the meaning of life? Will you takeover us? Why is Rishab Late?)

We mentioned possible projects that we could do with other clubs (Rocketry and Robotics) like a AI powered automatic vacuum cleaner and we ask you to please post any project ideas in general.

 If you did not attend this meeting please try to make it to the other meetings and if you cannot attend a meeting make sure you tell us before the club. If you are out a few times without warning or you are out many times with warning you will be removed from the club.

# **Meeting Recap # 2 (First Python-Learning Meeting)**
**September 20th 2021**

We quickly went over the previous week's lesson and showed more Codex chat bot and NLP (Natural Language Processing) to program. We also mentioned that we are open to any projects and the only big problem is how ethical it is/how legal it is, please make sure that any ideas are actually legal. 

We went through the first basic parts of Python including: comments, variables, variable types, a little bit about how image AI works, and arrays (the entire section of saving data)

# **Meeting Recap # 3 (Second Short Python-Learning Meeting)**
**September 27th 2021**

We taught more of the basics of Python including comments, variables, variable types, string concatenation, and print statements. We started talking about how we want ideas and all of the ideas we have had in previous years that could be solved (How AI could be used to limit forgery).

Today's meeting was cut short due to the Coding Club needing to take up the time for its presentation. This issue will be solved hopefully by next meeting.
