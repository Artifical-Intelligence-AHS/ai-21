# **Meeting Recap # 1 (Introduction Meeting)**

**September 13th 2021**

We presented the following PowerPoint to the class: https://tinyurl.com/IntroductionPowerPointAIClub
We showed an AI demo in which Kunal use Yolo to show an Image Detection system
We showed Codex and learned why: Rishab being late to the AI club meeting is "Unknown" (Codex has a chat bot in which you can ask any question, we had fun with it like asking questions including - What is the meaning of life? Will you takeover us? Why is Rishab Late?)

We mentioned possible projects that we could do with other clubs (Rocketry and Robotics) like a AI powered automatic vacuum cleaner and we ask you to please post any project ideas in general.

 If you did not attend this meeting please try to make it to the other meetings and if you cannot attend a meeting make sure you tell us before the club. If you are out a few times without warning or you are out many times with warning you will be removed from the club.

# **Meeting Recap # 2 (First Python-Learning Meeting)**
**September 20th 2021**

We quickly went over the previous week's lesson and showed more Codex chat bot and NLP (Natural Language Processing) to program. We also mentioned that we are open to any projects and the only big problem is how ethical it is/how legal it is, please make sure that any ideas are actually legal. 

We went through the first basic parts of Python including: comments, variables, variable types, a little bit about how image AI works, and arrays (the entire section of saving data)

# **Meeting Recap # 3 (Second Short Python-Learning Meeting)**
**September 27th 2021**

We taught more of the basics of Python including comments, variables, variable types, string concatenation, and print statements. We started talking about how we want ideas and all of the ideas we have had in previous years that could be solved (How AI could be used to limit forgery).

Today's meeting was cut short due to the Coding Club needing to take up the time for its presentation. This issue will be solved hopefully by next meeting.

# **Meeting Recap # 4 (Third Python-Learning Meeting / First mini-project)**

**October 4th 2021**

We taught more of the basics of Python including if statements, else if, else, functions, functions, touched on a little more about multi-line comments, briefly mentioned inputs, and conditional phrases. 

We made a simple "Bank" simulator as a mini-project to check on our ability to use operations and to learn more about programming. (Practical)

We used W3 schools to learn about if/elif/else statements.

W3 schools page we went over to teach Conditional (if/elif/else) statements
## Meeting Recap # 5 (Fourth Python-Learning Meeting / AI project introduction)
**October 18th 2021**

We taught more about Python and learn about loops and the types of loops. (Loop and a half, while loops, infinite loops, for loops, looping through arrays, and looping through strings) We also briefly touched about  input and understood how to use the input.

We learned a little bit about how AI works and how Optical Character Recognition works with AWS. (Learned about how a computer will check patterns to find a similarity between the given data and the entered image/information)

We learned about how to clone from the github and slightly touched on GitBash

We also mentioned how we recommend that you setup a IDE for programming (For now Atom (Recommended) or Visual Studios Code)

## Meeting Recap # 6 (First-group meeting)
**October 25th 2021**

### **Begineer Group**
We split up into groups today and in the beginner's group worked on everything we have learned so far, until for loops. (Input, Print, Variables/Variable Types, Casting, Concatenation, For loops, and if statements)

We added a bit of terrible programmer humor with: 
!False
Its funny because its true

(! = not, and not false means true ðŸ˜‰)

We recommend that you set-up and ide or online compiler that can help you work interactively in the club

Programming references will be on Github

### **Advanced Group**

We set up Visual Studio Code on all computers and connected to the github. Also working on starting the *Voice Recognition* project using different APIs. 

## Meeting Recap # 7 (Beginner Group Learning/Project)
**November 1st 2021**

### **Begineer Group**
We split up into groups and learned about while loops, went over a little bit of casting, practiced debugging, and made a simple calculator that we will upgrade next meeting. (While loops)

If you did not come to this meeting set-up an ide or online compiler that can help you work interactively in the club (Jetbrains Datalore is a easy one)

If you did not attend this meeting please try to make it to the other meetings and if you cannot attend a meeting make sure you tell us before the club. If you are out a few times without warning or you are out many times with warning you will be removed from the club.

### **Advanced Group**
We broke down the project and started a theroetical design of the project. Set up the Voice Recognition project on google cloud platform and gave access to all students. We decided the name of project will be **Sphinx** and recorded different variences of speaking **Sphinx**. 

Using the recorded audio files we are going to split the audio into different parts to create a training dataset. In order to split, we will design a threshold set at background noise using the spectogram of the graph and get each point (Start and End) of saying **Sphinx**. We will send data to the API to recognize the words.

Also plan to use OpenAI *Codex* to create converstation with program. 

### **Advanced Group**

We finished up the calculations of start and end points of the audio files and sent them to the API to recognize the words. We also created a program that will use the API to create a conversation with the user.
