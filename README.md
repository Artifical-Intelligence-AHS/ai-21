# Artifical Intelligence Club 2021 

This will be the collaberative github for all the projects we will do during the 2021-22 year. Currently permissions are all admin but you are not allowed to commit to main, please create your own branch and create a pull request. 

## **Process to upload to GITHUB for AI Club**
This is the layed out process that we will go through in order to handle all the github branches and its needed requirments.

1. Send a request to #leadership in order to create your branch with the following
    - Explain general idea of project
    - Name for branch
    - Who do you plan on working on it (more people are welcome to add just the prelimeray ideas)
2.  Once the branch is approved, clone the respository using the following steps
3.  Download Gitbash 
4.  In terminal use `cd` to move to the location you want to clone the respitory to.
5.  Run the following command. `git clone https://github.com/Artificial-Intelligence-AHS/ai-21.git`
6. Run `cd ai-21` in order to go into the directory just created
7. Run `ls` and the response should be `Meeting-Recap/  PROJECTS/  README.md  meetingPracticeCodes/  readMeInfo/`
8. Run `git branch -a` and response should include your added branch name
9. Run `git checkout -b *name-of-branch*` and the blue main should become your branch name
10. Run `git pull origin *name-of-branch*`

**Here you will open the code in your own IDE and make new files, change files and do everything you want to write**

11. Run `git add .` see all the changes detected
12. Run `git commit -m "*message-describing-change-you made(quick)*"`
13. Run `git push -u origin *name-of-branch*`
